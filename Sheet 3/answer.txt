a) The answer can be seen in the first plot generated

b) The function can be seen in the second generated plot

c) Increases the population size causes the variety of the
indivisuals to increase as well. Eventually leading to a better
max, and a better average of the fitness function in each generation

d) Increasing mutation rate decreases the max value of each generation,
as well as the average fitness. This is because the randomness of the
indivisual increases, and the algorithm starts degrading into a
random search.

e) Setting the mutation rate to 0 can cause the fitness of indivisuals
to be stuck in a local minimum. It decreases the value of the maximum,
and the average fitness of a generation. This lack of diversity can be
seen from how similar the plot of the maximum and the plot of the 
average fitness are.

f) Changing the fitness function in this way (by adding 50 to number
of ones) reduces the quality of the solution.
The reason is, it decreases the relative difference in the fitness between 
indivisuals. Causing the selection process to be more forgiving.
Meaning the unfit indivisuals are more likely to be selected from
crossover, while more fit indivisuals are less likely to be selected.
