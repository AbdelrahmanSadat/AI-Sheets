- On average, the adaptive hill climb executes faster on the sphere
problem, while also being more suitable for it than the rastrigin function.
This is likely because the rastrigin function has a large number of local
minima as opposed to the sphere function, so it can easily get stuck
in a non-optimal solution space.
